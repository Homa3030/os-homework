Standart IO buffer is a line buffer. 

Program 1 puts Hello into the buffer and then forks. 
Hello hasn't been displayed yet. Thus, both processes have
Hello in their buffers. Thus, printing \n causes both buffers to flush.
Outcome: Hello is printed twice.

Program 1 puts Hello\n into the buffer and then forks.
Because of that \n, buffer is flushed and the process with empty 
buffers both. Then we have print of \n, which simply
causes blank line to be printed twice.
Outcome: Hello is printed once altogether with two blank lines.
